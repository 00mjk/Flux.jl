# The Julia Ecosystem

One of the main strengths of Julia lies in an ecosystem of packages 
globally providing a rich and consistent user experience.

This is a non-exhaustive list of Julia packages, nicely complementing `Flux` in typical
machine learning and deep learning workflows:

- [ArgParse.jl](https://github.com/carlobaldassi/ArgParse.jl): package for parsing command-line arguments to Julia programs.
- [Augmentor.jl](https://github.com/Evizero/Augmentor.jl): a fast image augmentation library in Julia for machine learning.
- [BSON.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/BSON.jl): package for working with the Binary JSON serialisation format
- [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl): in-memory tabular data in Julia
- [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl):  a scientific project assistant software
- [MLDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl): utility package for accessing common machine learning datasets
- [OnlineStats.jl](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl): single-pass algorithms for statistics
- [Parameters.jl](https://github.com/mauro3/Parameters.jl): types with default field values, keyword constructors and (un-)pack macros
- [ProgressMeters.jl](https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl): progress meters for long-running computations
- [TensorBoardLogger.jl](https://github.com/PhilipVinc/TensorBoardLogger.jl): easy peasy logging to [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) in Julia

This tight integration among Julia pakages is shown in some of the examples in the [model-zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo) repository.

List of packages built on top of Flux:

- [FluxArchitectures](https://github.com/sdobber/FluxArchitectures): Complex neural network examples for Flux.jl.
- [DiffEqFlux](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqFlux.jl): DiffEqFlux.jl fuses the world of differential equations with machine learning by helping users put diffeq solvers into neural networks
- [Flux3D](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux3D.jl): Flux3D.jl is a 3D vision library, written completely in Julia.
- [ReinforcementLearning](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl): ReinforcementLearning.jl, as the name says, is a package for reinforcement learning research in Julia.
- [FluxOptTools](https://github.com/baggepinnen/FluxOptTools.jl): Flux integration with Optim.jl.
- [GeometricFlux](https://github.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl): GeometricFlux is a geometric deep learning library for Flux.
